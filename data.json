    "description": "\n        \n\nWho We Are\ntheCoderSchool is the #1 after-school coding program in Silicon Valley. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World. \n\nhttp://southbay.thecoderschool.com/\n\nJob Summary\ntheCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for 2-30 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule. Our open hours will be generally 3:30-7:30pm on select weekdays and Saturdays from 10am-4pm. If you have availability in other hours, please let us know. We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a \"teaching methodology\" than a curriculum. Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills. We are hiring immediately for both In-Person and Remote Coaches.\n\nResponsibilities\nA Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have two basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire. \n1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids. Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger kids and Javascript/HTML, Python and Game Dev for older kids. Specialty programming like Unity/C#, Swift, or Roblox/Minecraft is a huge plus! \n2. Group Code Class. Inspire students who are new to code with instructor-led projects. Work with a more set-curriculum for drag-and-drop languages that you'll teach in a classroom style using the \"Scratch\" environment that was developed by MIT.\n\nThis position rocks because you will:\n* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application.\n* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in Silicon Valley.\n* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology\n\nRequirements\nWhat do we want from you? Read on.\n* PASSION. All caps! You ooze excitement for technology; you can't wait to play with the latest 3D gaming platform. Your students must be inspired by your energy and enthusiasm :)\n* Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course it's often necessary to explain concepts in a few different ways!\n* Kid at heart. Our best coaches understand what gets kids excited because they love the same things: gamers please apply!\n* Coding Skills. Strong grasp of basic procedural programming. General knowledge of one or more languages is assumed - Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, C#, Java, and C++ are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't necessarily required - we prefer you communicate and empathize well with your students. \n* Big bonus for game development and app development: Unity, LUA, Roblox, Swift, Minecraft, etc\n* Experience teaching kids is a plus\n* College and high school students with an AP Computer Science (Java) background encouraged to apply\n* U.S. Citizens or Permanent Green-Card only; clean criminal background check required (no Felony, Misdemeanor or DUI convictions)\n\nInterested? Send us an email with a cover letter and resume. Let's do this!\n\n    ",
